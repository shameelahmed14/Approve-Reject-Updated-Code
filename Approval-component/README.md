## App Details

Salesforce in default doesn't have a screen to approve or reject the pending approval items in one go. Users need to click/ open each item and do the approvals. This screen enables user to select the records and do the approvals by clicking Approve or Reject button. This component is developed on LWC framework which is faster and lightweight in salesforce platform. Since this is a generic screen, so we can place anywhere. This build is initial commit.

- Choose `All users` while deploying the package.
> ***Before you install***, 
Create a approval process in contact object named as `Test_Approval` with entry criteria as `LastName` is not blank and activate. This is used for installing package. After installation completes, delete this approval process. we are doing this because approval process is not available for packaging.

### Reference :+1:
  - [SFDCMonkey](https://sfdcmonkey.com/2020/04/11/approval-screen-sfdc-lightning/) - provides the basic approach on mass approval using AURA and apex which is simple and I just made it in LWC with more options.
