# Multi Approval Process Widget


## App Details

Salesforce in default doesn't have a screen to approve or reject the pending approval items in one go. Users need to click/ open each item and do the approvals. This screen enables user to select the records and do the approvals by clicking Approve or Reject button. This component is developed on LWC framework which is faster and lightweight in salesforce platform. Since this is a generic screen, so we can place anywhere. This build is initial commit.
